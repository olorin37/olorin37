### Hi there 👋

My current work is closed sources, I can't share here the most of it.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on DevOps staff: Jenkins, Elasticsearch and other internal apps deployments as code. And declarative configuratoin of all used services.
- λ Functional programming languages are my passion. Especially: Haskell, OCaml, Scala, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir.
- 💬 Ask me about: bash, jq, DevOps, podman/docker.
